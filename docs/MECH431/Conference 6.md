# Conference 6



## Agenda

### Midterm 1

- Grades for take-home format is higher than expected (good thing).
- Midterm 2 will be less forgiving (but the final project grading would be).



### Project

- Include risk analysis in the outline, and as course progress, hopefully they can be integrated (usually risk analysis is weaker).
- For the risk analysis, for the minimum, do a sensitivity analysis. What inputs are the model most sensitive to? Identify two to three that could cause potential issues.
- Then do a break-even analysis on that.
- Ensure the flow of the report works logically (i.e. it makes more sense to put *market analysis* before *estimated revenue*).
- Consider **sources of funding** and how it affects cost of capital, MARR.



### Kinder Morgan Piazza Discussion Follow-up

- Federal government will buy KMP. They sold the existing pipeline along with work that's been done on the expanded pipeline for \$4.5B.

|                | Existing                            | Expansion            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Purchase price | $   4,500,000,000.00                | $   4,500,000,000.00 |
| Annual benefit | $       200,000,000.00              | $   1,200,000,000.00 |
| Construction   | $                                 - | $   8,000,000,000.00 |

- If we consider the pipeline to be a long term investment (25 years), and we can get the interest rate the government is assuming (5%):

  - Present value is \$2.892B, we can say that we over paid.
  - If the interest rate were to be 0.8%, then we would approximately break even.

- If we consider the expanded pipeline, at 0.8%, then the PV is \$27.092B, while the cost is only \$12.5B.

- If the oil demand lowers, it becomes a risk to the project (need consideration). We might want to sell existing pipeline (ignore inflation and deprecation).

  - Key factor for the resale price: lifetime and interest rate.
  - Buyer would probably have to finance or sell equity to make the purchase.
  - Suppose 20 years left, at 6%, the NPV is \$2.294B.
  - Accounting for the resale value, from the government's perspective (with revenue of \$200M for the first 5 years), we lose $1.3B.



## Question

**Q: will midterm 1 be scaled down?**

> no, but midterm 2 will be quite different.

**Q. How different should first draft or final report be?**

> Ideally, the same.
>
> First draft feedback isn't going to be fully detailed and would only outline logic or information flaws.

**Q. Seen a perfect report?**

> B is easy. High A is tough.

**Q. How not to give up easily on one topic before choosing another one?**

> Gathering information for a topic is hard. Find suitable survey data etc.
>
> For "how do I do this", contact Dr. Hollett.

**Q. Confidential information in report?**

> If information is from UBC, professor reading it is fine.
>
> If information is from companies, then anonymize the information such that it can be viewed publicly, or provide NDA to professor.

**Q. What should the presentation outline look like?**

> Make is specific to your topic, don't be too generic (i.e. cost and revenue model with a detailed description outlining input, outputs, and analysis).
