Invigilating a midterm exam is boring, one fo the thing I need to do is to count the number of students that are present at the exam.

<!-- excerpt -->

Of course, that's still boring, so I counted other things as well.

Here are some of the statistics I've found with a sample size of 100 students.

- 23% regularly wrote with their exam paper slanted (more than 30 degrees)

- 40% wears glasses

  > Interestingly, [Central Bureau of Statistics of Netherlands](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2013/38/more-than-6-in-10-people-wear-glasses-or-contact-lenses) reports that 61% of population wears glasses or contacts, and 41% of population with age between 20 and 30 wears glasses. The number is around 32% for age between 16 and 20.

- 11% wrote the exam with pen

- 27% (Surprisingly low) brought a water bottle

- 13% are left handed

  > According to [Hardyck et al. in their 1977 findings](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1978-00208-001?doi=1), about 10% of the population is left handed.

  > It is also been said that a higher ratio of left-handed people to right-handed people is found in more intelligent, talented, and over-achieving groups of people.
  >
  > This make sense with our 13% because people who are intelligent are extremely likely to choose post-secondary eduction. Furthermore, they are likely to pursue fields in STEM.

- 12% wore watches

- 5% wore hats

- 10% wore red shirt/hoodies

  > This seems to be the dominant color besides black, white, or shades in between. Could this be because of the engineering colors of UBC?

- 30% were still writing when there was less than 1 minute left

I was bored. The data was gathered out of boredom. This post is written out of boredom.
