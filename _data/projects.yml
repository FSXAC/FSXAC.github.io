  description: As machine learning is employed in more portable and remote devices, programmable digital circuits such as field-programmable-gate-arrays (FPGAs) are attractive given the speed and flexibility they provide. In this project, we explored integrating an object detection model (YOLOv2) onto a portable package with an FPGA, camera, and processor. To demonstrate its portability, the system is mounted to a drone, showcasing its potential deployability in remote or highly-portable situations. This project won the UBC APSC Capstone Faculty Award.
