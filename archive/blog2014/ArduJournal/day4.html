				No actual explosive is produced throughout this project. The word "bomb" is in quotation marks because 
				it is not an actual explosive but rather just some flashing LEDs. </i></p>
				<p> I am going to start a new project; this time it is going to include a small speaker and, hopefully, 
				the LCD in combination.</p>
				<p> Once again, this is based on the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive like the last project. (<a 
				href = "day2.html" style = "font-size: 16px;">StatTrak LCD Project</a>) This is the "bomb" terrorists carry 
				in the game. </p>
				<p> How it works in the game: <br/>
				> The Terrorists take 4 seconds to enters the code "7355608" to plant the "bomb". <br/>
				> The "bomb" will have have 45 seconds of countdown before it explodes. <br/>
				> Counter-Terrorists take 10 seconds to defuse the "bomb", and 5 seconds if they have defuse-kits. <br/>
				> If the CTs do not manage to finish defusing in 45 seconds, the "bomb" will explode. <br/>
				</p>
				<p> The sound of the "bomb": <br/>
				> When the "bomb" is planted, it makes a beep every second. But as the time counts down, 
				the "bomb" will beep faster and faster. <br/>
				> At the last second before the "bomb" explodes, a chirp sound followed by rapid beeps initiates the "explosion". <br/>
				> "Terrorists Win!"

				<hr/>
				<p>Initially, I only have a speaker and LED hooked up to the Arduino so it could make a noise and a flash as the "bomb" 
				counts down. Very simple, Code below (very messy):</p>
				<pre><code><xmp>
// LCD library
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

// creating an LCD object with pins as arguments
LiquidCrystal lcd(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);

int timeDelay = 1000;
int seconds = 0;
int newSeconds = 0;

String exploded = "not";
int startTime = millis();

int explodeTone = 2834;
int explodeToneRate = 144;

int armIteration = 0;
int armTone = 3520;
int armLength = 35;
int armDelay = 90;

void setup() {
	// put your setup code here, to run once:
	pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
	pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
	Serial.begin(9600);
	lcd.begin(16, 2);
}

void loop() {
	// if the bomb hasn't exploded, keep counting
	if (exploded == "not") {
		newSeconds = millis() / 1000;
		digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
		if (newSeconds != seconds) {
			timeDelay = timeDelay - 20;
			seconds = newSeconds;
		}

		tone(8, 4000, 100);
		delay(timeDelay);

		startTime = millis();

		if (timeDelay < 110) {
			delay(100);
			exploded = "armed";
		}
	} 
	else if (exploded == "armed") {
		arm();
		explode();
		exploded = "exploding";
	} 
	else {
		delay(10000);
	}
}

// make the chirp sound
void arm() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 50; i ++) {
		explodeTone = explodeTone + explodeToneRate;
		tone(8, explodeTone, 50);
		delay(20);
	} 
}

// make the explosion tone
void explode() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 12; i ++) {
		tone(8, armTone, armLength);
		delay(armDelay);
		armIteration ++;
	} 
}							
				</xmp></code></pre>
				<p>But this is not good enough. <br/>
				First, the "bomb" is not authentic enough. It is still missing elements. Second, the code is not very 
				good, it is extremely messy as well as inefficient. So I'm planning to re-write the code.</p>

				<p>Yes it is been a while since I last worked on the project but I have got some progress.</p>
				<p>I've added new components to the bread board including an LCD to display the bomb-code, three buttons: one for 
				planting, one for defusing, the last one for defusing with kits.</p>

				<p>I haven't touched around with the code yet, so I'll have to do that.</p>

				<hr/>
				<p>I just watched a great tutorial on LCDs on YouTube by a guy named <a style = "font-size: 16px" 
				href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR6qP2sVBZUL4IJOXUhCofA">000Plasma000</a>, here is the link to 
				the video: <a style = "font-size: 16px;" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85LvW1QDLLw">
				https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85LvW1QDLLw</a></p>
				<p>Anyway, what he talked about is some of the basic knowledge and commands people should know about LCDs. 
				Some of the things that caught my eyes are the commands I didn't know about. Here a few of them:</p>
				<p>Using <code class = "Single">.blink()</code> method from the LCD library will enable a blinking cursor. 
				<code class = "Single">.noBlink()</code> will disable it.</p>
				<center><img src = "http://www.emmanuelmorales.com/images/blinking-cursor.gif"/></center>
				<p>Using <code class = "Single">.cursor()</code> will enable a regular underline cursor like "_". Similar to 
				the blinking cursor, <code class = "Single">.noCursor()</code> method can be used to turn it off.</p>
				<p>But perhaps one the of the coolest thing I've learnt today about the LCD is the ability to create custom characters. 
				On a standard liquid crystal display, all characters are made of pixels. In this case each block on the LCD have a 5x8 
				pixel pattern.</p>
				<p>An array list of 0's and 1's can be created to make the character. It's kind of hard to explain so I'll just put the 
				code to how to do it here:</p>
				<pre><code><xmp>
...... some code above here ......				
				
// Create a new list of pixels that's going to be enabled outside of everything.
// A grid of 5x8 0's are created, they are the pixels on the LCD.
// 0 means off and 1 means on.
byte newCharacter[8] = {
	B00000,
	B00000,
	B00000,
	B00000,
	B00000,
	B00000,
	B00000,
	B00000
};

// SETUP
void setup() {
	lcd.begin(16, 2);
	
	// Use the .createChar() method to initate and store a new character into the LCD's memory
	// The parameters are (the position of memory where the character should be stored, the name of the byte array)
	lcd.createChar(1, newCharacter);
}

// LOOP
void loop() {
	// To display the character, use the .write() method 
	// with the position of memory where the character is stored as the argument
	lcd.write(1);
}
