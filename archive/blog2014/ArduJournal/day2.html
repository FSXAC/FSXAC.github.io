				<p>New project!</p>
				<p>This project is not included in the project book, but the idea is simple:</p>
				<p>Have a number counter that can be manipulated using a button, and output that number
				to a LCD. I also wanted another button that switches display mode. For example, one mode
				would be to display a static number count, another mode would flash through different 
				messages.</p>
				<p>I think this project would be more of a challenging task at the beginning since I 
				just done the LED projects. Doing stuff with a LCD is a huge leap.</p>

				<hr/>
				<p>I followed the tutorial on Arduino's official website on how to wire up an LCD. 
				The wiring itself was pretty straight forward, but slightly more confusing than ordinary LEDs. 
				Single coloured LEDs have two pins they needed to be connected to, one is power, the other is 
				ground. However, on the LCD, it's not as simple. </p>
				<p>On a LCD, like anything, it needs two pins that connect to power and ground. But an additional 
				set of the power and ground pins is required if I want it to be backlit. I can add a potentiometer 
				where the back-light connection is so that I can control the brightness. A display contrast pin 
				from the LCD is required to connect to power. Without it, the crystals in the screen will not 
				rotate, therefore will not produce an image. Adding a potentiometer would change the contrast. 
				For the pins that require more understanding of computer hardware: 
				There is the RS (register select) pin that controls where in the LCD's memory the data is 
				writing to. There is the R/W (pin) which selects whether if the LCD is in read mode or write mode. 
				And finally, there is E (enable) pin that enables writing to the registers. I don't exactly 
				know how to do cool stuff with these pins, they are essential to make the LCD work, so I'm not 
				going to mess with them. Just connect these pins in the right place and it'll be fine.</p>
				<p>Finally, we have the data pins on the LCD. There are 8 data pins, but minimum of only 4 is 
				required to make the LCD display something.</p>

				<p>I added two buttons, unlike the bread-board diagram above. One button is to increase the counter 
				and the other is to switch modes. Aside from buttons, other differences also include the 
				removal of the potentiometer because I don't feel like the need of it since the screen is 
				always the 100% contrast.</p>

				<hr/>
				<p>At this moment, I never feel like following through a tutorial series one by one and 
				completing all of them. What I am doing and what I want to do is projects that are interesting, 
				fun, challenging, and different for me. When I run into difficulties, that's when I look up tutorials. 
				I will try to come up with different and challenging parts that require different materials every time, 
				that way I am always learning how to construct using new parts or program using new libraries...
				<br/>
				For my next project I'll probably do something involves light / photo input using photoresistors</p>
