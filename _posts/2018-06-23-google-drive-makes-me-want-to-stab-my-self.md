It all started when I wanted to download all my photos from Google Photos which was auto-synced from my phone.

<!-- excerpt -->

I did a typical search to see how, and it turns out I need to do some convoluted steps involving going into my Google Drive settings and turning on an option that creates a 'Google Photos' folder in my Google Drive.

OK cool! I open the folder in the browser to check that the files are there, sure is. I right click the current directory and it has a 'Download' option, the web app prompts me that it is zipping all the files for download.

This part is very slow and painful because it doesn't tell you any information besides that it is zipping.

After the download is complete, I immediately notice that it's fishy because the .zip file is only 2GB and obvious doesn't contain all the photos I needed to download. I once again check the content inside the Google Drive folder in the browser to make sure Google Photos' photos is appearing correctly in Drive. It is.

Try again I suppose. I went back to Google Drive and tried again. While it is zipping, I went outside to get coffee. I came back 45 min later expecting the complete download to be finished. NOPE! NOTHING!. The zipping prompt in the browser has disappeared. The browser download history shows nothing new. What gives?

I tried once more. Sitting through the slow and painful process, staring at the circular, non-informative progress icon. Yes! The download has started. No! The download is only 2GB. -_-. What the fuck Google???.

Ok I understand that maybe we don't want to download 25GB in a single zip file, but you have to at least give me multiple links to zip files that make up the entire folder right? It's useless if I can only download 2/25 fraction of the thing I want to download.

OK. It's time to try another approach. Since the photos reside in Google Drive. I can just sync it to my local drive. The Google desktop app has a feature to select specifically which folder we want to sync, so that's perfect.

Except...when it prompts me to select folders to sync, it also indicated there will be a total of 80 GB even when no folder is selected!

Yes I see that at the bottom where it says "Files not contained in a folder automaticaly sync". But what is weird is that in my Google drive, the files that are not contained in the folder are just mere megabytes consisting of a few Google Docs and PDFs.

Where the hell is that 80GB coming from? Not anywhere does it provide indication of the source. Does it contain stuff that people shared to me?

I checked everywhere, on every app on every platform I owned. I dug through the web and desktop Google Drive, I sift through the menus and pages in the mobile app. Nowhere can I even find a capacity breakdown of my Drive. Nowhere does it indicate what these 80GB contain or where it's from. Bad design!

My laptop doesn't have enough space to sync the **mandatory** 80GB, so it looks like I'll have to uninstall some large, although useful programs that I use from my system just so I can proceed.

Fuck this! I give up trying to deal with Google's shitty UX and apps.
