## Expected Value and Variance

Given a random variable $X_i$, $\mathbb E(X_i)=\mu_i$ and $\text{Var}(X_i)=\sigma^2$

The weights can be described as
$$
W_n=a_1 x_1+ a_2 x_2+\dots+a_nx_n
$$
so 
$$
\mathbb E(W_n)=\mathbb E(a_1x_1+\dots a_nx_n)=a_1\mu_1+\dots+a_n\mu_n
$$
and
$$
\text{Var}(W_n)=a_1^2\sigma_1^2+\dots+a^2_n\sigma_n^2
$$
**Consider**

$X_i$ are independent, $\mathbb E(X_i)=\mu$, and $\text{Var}(X_i)=\sigma^2$
$$
S_n=x_1+\dots+x_n
$$
Thus $\mathbb E(S_n)=n\mu$ and $\text{Var}(S_n)=\sigma_1^2+\dots+\sigma_n^2$.

If $\bar{X_n}=\frac{X_1+\dots+X_n}{n}$. then $\mathbb E(\bar{X_n})=\frac{n\mu}{n}=\mu$, and $\text{Var}(\bar{X_n})=\frac{1}{n}\sigma^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$.



## Chebyshev Inequality

We want to prove the following inequality:
$$
\mathbb P(|X-\mu|\geq\epsilon)\leq\frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}
$$
Proof:

Let's start with definition of variance for continuous random variable:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^2f(x)\mathrm dx&\geq\int_{|x-\mu|\geq\epsilon}(x-\mu)^2f(x)\mathrm dx\\
&\geq\epsilon^2\int_{|x-\mu|\geq\epsilon}f(x)\mathrm dx = \epsilon^2\mathbb P(|X-\mu|\geq\epsilon)
\end{aligned}
$$


**Consider** previous example:
$$
\mathbb P(|\bar{X_n}-\mu|\geq\epsilon)\leq\frac{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}}{\epsilon^2}=\frac{\sigma^2}{n\epsilon^2}
$$

## Problem Set A

### A.12

For a majority decoding algorithm, if majority of the ($2N+1$) transmitted identical digits are received correctly, then the received digit is considered correctly decoded. Let $X$ be the number of errors in the transmission of the ($2N+1$) transmitted identical digits, and $p$ as the probability that each of the ($2N+1$) bits can be decoded correctly on its own. Assume that the errors in each of the ($2N+1$) positions are independent of each other. 

> So if the transmitted bits are `000`, for the receiving bits to be `010`, the probability is $(p)(1-p)(p)=p^2(1-p)$

(a) If $N=2, p=0.8$, what is the probability that one transmitted bit using majority decoding algorithm is decoded correctly? 

> Total bits are $2(2)+1=5$ bits, so if there is at least 3 changed, it cannot be decoded correctly.
>
> Then we can say the probability of 3 bits unchanged is
> $$
> {5 \choose 3}(1-p)^2p^3
> $$
> Which is the binomial random variable formula / distribution:
> $$
> {n\choose k}(p)^k(1-p)^{n-k}
> $$
> So the probability of decoding correctly is
> $$
> \mathbb P(C)=\sum_{k=N+1}^{2N+1}{2N+1\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{2N+1-k}
> $$
> Plugging the number in, we get $0.942$

(b) If we only want use 3 identical bits in the majority decoding algorithm, what is the minimum $p$ required to have a better performance compared to (a)? 



(c) If we use 7 identical bits, repeat (b).
