# Professionalism

The first step once the project is selected is to contact with the client. Following the “protocol” is recommended.

## 1. Introduction

Introduce the team to the client via phone or email. Make sure the email or Skype ID is professional. Make sure one knows who they’re addressing.

## 2. Audience

- Know your audience
- The client is most likely busy people. Please ensure conciseness.

The audience would most likely be not impressed wtih:

- Vague email,
- Too much or too little detail
- Typos, ppoor gramar, or informal tone

Also to make sure to use non-abbreviated words, especially if they’re UBC specific such as “ECE”.

## 3. Purpose

Communicate clearly the purpose of the communication. 

## 4. Context

Provide client’s situation and the team’s situation. Be specific in the subject line and identify yourselves with enthusiasm. Indicate approximate duration of the meeting or phone call.

## 5. Sign Off

Sign off in a positive, non-presumptuous tone. Example

> We would appreciate such an opportunity and look forward to hearing from you. We can be contacted by email at ….
>
> Best regards,

## Additional Good Practices

- Non-verbal communication is carefully addressed
- Respect the audience or client.
- Be clear and use correct grammar
- be ready to meet at their location and the time best available for the client.
- Do not immediately commit to any new ideas that come up. Instead use professional language to express consideration or declination.
